# Decision log

## 2026-07-19 — League-v1 bootstrap

- Use 10 learners with independent seeds and hyperparameter/opponent-sampling diversity.
- Refresh public opponents daily but train and evaluate against immutable, hashed snapshots.
- Require every learner to pass every public opponent; use paired seats/common seeds and a Wilson lower-bound gate.
- Keep champion and historical agents in the league after public-pool mastery to reduce cycling and forgetting.
- Do not merge, submit, or claim training success before server gameplay evaluation.

## 2026-07-19 — DATA-001/002 public replay gate

- Treat replay action/observation alignment as an experiment, not an assumed schema. Compare previous-step and same-step candidates on real episodes and require at least 99.9% legal labels.
- Do not train from the committed legacy majority model; its label/action consistency audit failed.
- Standardize public replay decisions before modeling. Each row contains only the acting player's view, the legal option set, the selected action, outcome, manifest metadata, and source hash.
- Remove `observation.logs` from model input by default and never combine both players' views.
- Give policy loss weight to winning strong-teacher decisions; retain losing trajectories for value learning and failure analysis.
- Keep DATA-001/002 on `exp/league-v1`. Real-data results must be produced on the server before any merge recommendation.
